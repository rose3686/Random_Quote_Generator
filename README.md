# Random Quote Generator

This is a simple JavaScript project that generates random motivational quotes using the [API.quotable](https://api.quotable.io/random). The project uses `fetch` to make API requests and fetch quotes for display.

## Usage

To use this project, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your browser. Click the "New Quote" button to fetch a new random quote from the API.

## API Key

Please note that this project does not require an API key to function, as it uses the public endpoints of the Quotable API by 
lukePeavey.
